4. What is an abstract class in C# and for which purpose we use it?

   Abstract classes are used for polimorhism. You can not create a abstract class instance. It can includes fields, properties, functions and constructors. 
In Abstract class you can create virtual functions. Whenever a class inherit from an abstract class, it can override the virtual methods. We use abstract class
for a template. For example If I need a base class and then the other classes inherit from this class but some methods in base class need to be changed when the others inherit then I use abstract class for base class. (Note I can explain this in Turkish better.)
